## ðŸ“š About the Project

This C++ implementation demonstrates the key elements of a blockchain:

- **Immutable chain structure**
- **Fixed 10 transactions per block**

The goal is to showcase blockchain principles that support **data integrity**, **tamper resistance**, and **trustless verification**, all of which are critical in cybersecurity.


## Abstraction


## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the Cybersecurity course at the University of Houston to explore the core cryptographic principles that underpin modern blockchain systems. The objective was to build a simplified, educational version of a blockchain in C++, inspired by the foundational ideas of Bitcoin.

The implementation focuses on three key areas critical to blockchain integrity and security:  
- Cryptographic Hashing (SHA-256): Ensures data immutability and block linkage.
- Merkle Trees: Efficiently represent and verify the integrity of transactions within a block.
- Proof-of-Work (PoW): Simulates computational difficulty to secure new block creation.

Each block in the chain is constructed with a fixed number of ten transactions, mimicking real-world batching mechanisms, and contains the blockâ€™s hash, previous block hash, and a Merkle root of its transactions. By mining blocks and linking them cryptographically, the project illustrates how any change to historical data renders the chain invalid â€” a core security feature of blockchain technology.

From a cybersecurity perspective, this project reinforces how blockchain resists tampering, supports data integrity, and builds distributed trust without relying on central authorities. While this is a simplified version, it successfully demonstrates the underlying mechanisms that make blockchain a powerful tool in secure, decentralized systems.


## Blockchain Fundamentals (Background)

In this section, we explore the core building blocks of blockchain technology. These components form the cryptographic and structural foundation that makes blockchain secure, immutable, and relevant to the field of cybersecurity.

### What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed, append-only data structure that stores information in a chain of blocks. Each block contains a batch of data (typically transactions), along with metadata that links it cryptographically to the previous block. This chain-like architecture ensures that any modification to an earlier block affects all subsequent blocks, making tampering computationally infeasible.

Blockchains are decentralized â€” no single party has control over the entire chain â€” and rely on consensus mechanisms to agree on the current state of data. This structure makes blockchains inherently resistant to data modification, which is why they are widely used in secure, trustless environments like cryptocurrencies, digital voting, and supply chain tracking.

### What Is a Merkle Root?

A Merkle root is a single hash that summarizes all transactions in a block by recursively hashing them in pairs until a single digest remains. This is done using a Merkle Tree, a binary tree of hashes where:
- The leaves are the individual hashes of each transaction.
- Each non-leaf node is the hash of its two child nodes.
- The top-most node is the Merkle root.

Merkle roots allow efficient and secure verification of large data sets. In blockchain:
- They allow verification of individual transactions without revealing the full data set.
- They provide integrity guarantees: if even one transaction changes, the Merkle root changes.

This efficiency is particularly important in lightweight clients (e.g., SPV nodes in Bitcoin) that do not download the entire blockchain but still want to verify transaction inclusion.

### Hashing & SHA-256

Hashing is the process of converting arbitrary data into a fixed-size string of characters using a mathematical function called a hash function. Hashes are:

- Deterministic: the same input always gives the same output.
- Non-reversible: you cannot recover the input from the output.
- Collision-resistant: it's hard to find two different inputs with the same output.

In this project, we use SHA-256, a member of the Secure Hash Algorithm 2 family, producing a 256-bit (32-byte) hash. SHA-256 is:

- Widely used in blockchain, especially Bitcoin.
- Considered secure (as of today) against known pre-image and collision attacks.
- Critical for linking blocks, hashing transactions, and computing Merkle roots.

Each blockâ€™s identity is based on its SHA-256 hash, which includes key metadata like the previous hash, Merkle root, timestamp, and nonce. Even a one-bit change in the blockâ€™s data causes the resulting hash to change drastically â€” this is known as the avalanche effect.


## Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Proof-of-Work is a consensus algorithm that requires participants (called miners) to perform a certain amount of computational work to add a new block to the chain. This "work" typically involves finding a nonce value such that the resulting hash of the block's header starts with a certain number of leading zero bits (difficulty).

This ensures:
- Blocks cannot be added instantly; time and energy are required.
- Altering a block would require re-mining it and all subsequent blocks.
- The system is resistant to Sybil attacks, where malicious actors try to flood the network with fake identities.

In our project, PoW is implemented by brute-forcing the nonce value until the SHA-256 hash of the block starts with N zeros (e.g., `0000...`), simulating real-world mining difficulty.


## Importance of Immutability in Cybersecurity

In cybersecurity, immutability â€” the guarantee that once data is written it cannot be altered â€” is a highly valued property. Blockchain achieves immutability through a combination of cryptographic hashing, Merkle trees, and consensus algorithms like PoW.

This immutability offers several security advantages:

- Tamper detection: Any unauthorized change in historical data breaks the chain.
- Auditability: All actions and changes are permanently recorded and traceable.
- Trustless environments: Participants do not need to trust each other; trust is placed in the protocol.

In the context of this project, the blockchain serves as a miniature secure ledger where transaction history cannot be forged without redoing significant computational work, aligning with the core principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) in cybersecurity.
